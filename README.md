# Little Lemon website for Meta Professional Frontend Developer Course and Certification

This is a mock website for a non-existant chicago restaurant. It was created for the Meta "Professional Frontend Developer" capstone class. The only pages that reall work are the home page and the reservations page/form. Other pages are out of scope of the assignment.
